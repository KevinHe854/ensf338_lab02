1. Describe the algorithm you will use to find the room. **Assume all the information you have is the one given by the sign; you have no knowledge of the floor plan**.

> I would start searching on the left side of the hall at EY100 and increment by one room until I find room EY128.

2. How many ”steps” it will take to find room EY128? And what is a “step” in this case?

> This would take 15 steps to find the room.
A step here would be everytime we check a room.

3. Is this a best-case scenario, worst-case scenario, or neither?

> This is neither a best or worst-case scenario.

4. With this particular sign and floor layout, explain what a worst-case or best-case scenario would look like?

> A best-case scenario would be finding EY128 at the very start of the hall. A worst-case scenario would be finding the room at the end of the hall.

5. Suppose after a few weeks in the term you memorize the layout of the floor. How would you improve the algorithm to make it more efficient?

> I would start looking from the right side of the hall or just memorize where the room is to get to the room quicker.
